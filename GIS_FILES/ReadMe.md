There are two options on viewing the GIS data:

1. Open the produced ArcMAP `.mxd` files or shapefiles
2. Follow the step by step tutorial to reproduce the analysis

##1. Open the produced files
To view the previous produced shapefiles or `.mxd` files, simply download the files from the [download server](https://download.scrim.psu.edu/Ruckert_etal_San_Francisco/).

##2. Follow a step by step tutorial to reproduce the analysis
The instructions for this tutorial are within the **Flood\_map\_documentation.pdf** located here and on the [download server](https://download.scrim.psu.edu/Ruckert_etal_San_Francisco/). This tutorial describes the process as a step by step 
procedure. For ease in reproducibility, all data files and a python script are included on the [download server](https://download.scrim.psu.edu/Ruckert_etal_San_Francisco/).
