#GIS analysis

There are two options on viewing the GIS data:

1. Opening the produced shapefiles
2. Following a step by step tutorials to reproduce the shapefiles

##1. Opening the produced shapefiles
To view the previous produced shapefiles, simply download the **Analysis** folder, unzip all files, and open one of the .mxd files.

##2. Following a step by step tutorials to reproduce the shapefiles
The instructions for this tutorial are within the **Flood_Risk_Tutorial.pdf**. This tutorial describes the process as a step by step 
procedure. Although some of the necessary shapefiles are included in the **TUTORIAL** folder, the DEM raster files are not due to size. 
The DEMs can be downloaded from the [USGS National Elevation dataset:](http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/basic/?basemap=b1&category=ned,nedsrc&title=3DEP%20View) 

In the Product Search Filter click on the subfilter: 1/9 arc-second DEM, zoom into the San Francisco area, click Find Products, 
and download the following DEMs.
